**Making Sense of Car Ad Data.**

**Questions to answer:**

**Finding the Best Deals:**
Which ad category is cheapest per click?
We'll look at this in both Python and SQL, which are like computer languages for data.

**Top Sellers:**
Which ad campaigns brought in the most sales (considering the first interaction someone had with the ad)?
Again, in Python and SQL.

**Sales Growth:**
Which campaigns saw the biggest changes (up or down) in sales from October to December?

**Best Partners:**
Who gets us the most sales for the least money spent?

**ROI & Profit:**
Which ad categories give us the best return on investment (ROI)? ROI basically means how much money we make back for every dollar spent. We'll also look at how much profit we make.
We'll explain the formula for ROI and how to calculate profit.

**Beyond the Clicks: Understanding Customer Journeys**
How many different ad sources do people typically see before buying a car?
What percent of sales come from people who didn't click on an ad in the past 90 days? Why might this happen?

**Bonus: Spending Smarter**
Based on what we learned about ad performance, what's the best way to spend our extra budget next year (we're getting 20% more money!)?
